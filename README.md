# Socket Programming

This project implements a client-server system to provide information about the curriculum structure of a 4-year Computer Science major. The system allows clients to connect to the server and query various aspects of the curriculum.

- **Client-Server Communication**: Implemented using socket programming in Python.
- Client interacts with the server through a command-line interface.

## File Structure

- `client.py`: Contains the code for the client-side application, allowing users to query the server for information.
- `server.py`: Implements the server-side application, handling client requests and providing responses.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

1. Start the server by running `server.py`.
2. Run one or more instances of the client application `client.py`.
3. Follow the prompts in the client.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
